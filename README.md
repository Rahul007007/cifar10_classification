### To access the app, follow these steps:


Step 1: Access the app directly on the link (This does not use the FastAPI endpoints):
[https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrishanuDas/cifar10_classification](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrishanuDas/cifar10_classification)

Step 2: Use the Streamlit app via the FastAPI endpoint.(This could not be deployed due to non-accessibility of a non-crashable server like an AWS ec2 instance) 
- Run the FastAPI server on any instance using the following command:
    ```
    uvicorn api_endpoint:app --reload --host <host_name>
    ```
- Change the HOST variable on the `app_with_fastapi.py` file.
- Execute the app_with_fastapi.py file using the following command:
    ```
    streamlit run app_with_fastapi.py
    ```

### Files
